Class 5 - DNS over HTTPS/DNS over TLS (Pre TMOS 16.1)
=====================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NOTE: This lab is deprected for Class 6 and the native DoH/DoT support in TMOS, and is kepts for informational purposes only.**

In this lab, you will see DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) queries proxied in both directions. That is, traditional DNS queries will be proxied to backend DoT/DoH servers, as well as DoH/DoT queries being proxied to traditional DNS servers.

DoT is "simpler" to proxy as the original DNS protocol is simply encapsulated in TLS using client-SSL (DoT-to-DNS) or server-ssl (DNS-to-DoT) profiles.

DoH is a bit more complex as we must take the DNS request and encapsulate it into a binary HTTPS payload (DNS-to-DoH) or extract the binary payload and convert it into a traditional DNS query (DoH-to-DNS).

We will use the power of iRulesLX to handle this advanced task. Native functionality will be available in a near-future release of TMOS so that the iRules will not be necessary.

The lab consists of four sections:

-  Proxying DNS over HTTPS queries to traditional DNS servers

   -  In this section, you will use Mozilla Firefox as a DoH client to browse the web using encrypted DNS through the BIG-IP using DNS over HTTPS

-  Proxying DNS over TLS queries to traditional DNS servers

   -  In this section, you will use the kdig utility as a DoT client to perform queries through the BIG-IP using DNS over TLS

-  Proxying traditional DNS queries to DNS over HTTPS servers

   -  In this section, you will use the nslookup/dig utilities to send traditional DNS queries through the BIG-IP to Google's DoH service

-  Proxying traditional DNS queries to DNS over TLS servers

   -  In this section, you will use the nslookup/dig utilities to send traditional DNS queries through the BIG-IP to Google's DoT service
