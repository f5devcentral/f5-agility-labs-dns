F5 supports many APIs (Application Programmable Interfaces) including TMSH, WebUI, iControlREST, iControlLX and SNMP to name a few. In this task, the example company will deploy an additional service for FTP which requires geographic high availability. Postman will be used to execute configuration changes on the BIG-IP, which uses the iControlREST interface.
